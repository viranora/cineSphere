<br>

<div align="center">

<br>

A sleek, responsive, and feature-rich movie discovery application built entirely with React. CineSphere utilizes the TMDb API to provide a seamless browsing experience, complete with user personalization features powered by React Context and `localStorage`.

This project serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece demonstrating advanced frontend capabilities, including global state management, dynamic routing, and interaction with third-party APIs.

**This is a "frontend-only" build, meaning no backend database is required.** All user data (profile picture, liked movies, and watchlist) is intelligently persisted in the browser's `localStorage`.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Modern UI/UX:** Built with Tailwind CSS, featuring glassmorphism effects, smooth animations (`framer-motion`), and a dynamic, gradient-based theme.
* **Comprehensive Discovery:**
    * **Home Page:** Browse curated lists for "Popular", "Top Rated", and "Upcoming" movies.
    * **Discover by Genre:** A dedicated page to explore movies by specific genres (e.g., Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi).
    * **Powerful Search:** A fully functional search with pagination for finding any movie in the TMDb database.
* **Rich Detail Pages:**
    * **Movie Details:** View movie summaries, ratings, cast, and similar movies.
    * **Dynamic Backgrounds:** The movie detail page's background dynamically adapts to the poster's dominant color.
    * **Embedded Trailers:** Watch official YouTube trailers directly in a modal.
    * **Actor Details:** Click on any cast member to navigate to their dedicated page, showing their biography and filmography.
* **Persistent User Profile (via `localStorage`):**
    * **Global State:** Uses **React Context API** to manage all user lists and profile information across the entire application.
    * **Like & Save:** Add movies to your "Liked" list or "Watchlist" from any movie card.
    * **Profile Page:** A central hub to view your liked and saved movie collections in separate rows.
    * **Custom Profile Picture:** Upload and persist your own profile picture (converts image to Base64 and stores in `localStorage`).
* **Fully Responsive:** Designed to look and work great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
